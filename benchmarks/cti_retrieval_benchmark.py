CTI Retrieval Benchmark — Tests ZettelForge on real CTI queries.

Unlike LOCOMO (conversational memory), this tests what ZettelForge
is actually built for: threat actor attribution, tool mapping,
CVE linkage, campaign tracking, and temporal intel queries.

Measures accuracy and latency for both chunking strategies:
  - full_session: store entire intel reports as single notes (current)
  - chunked_800: split reports into 800-char chunks on sentence boundaries

Usage:

In 2024, APT28 shifted its primary initial access vector from spearphishing emails to exploitation of edge network devices, particularly VPN appliances and firewalls. The group has been observed using Cobalt Strike beacons for command and control, and deploying the DROPBEAR backdoor for persistent access. APT28 has targeted NATO member states, defense contractors, and energy sector organizations. The group exploited CVE-2024-1111 in Fortinet FortiGate devices for initial access in multiple campaigns during Q1 2024. CERT-UA attributed the SedUploader malware to APT28 operations in Ukraine.""",

The group is known for financially motivated attacks targeting cryptocurrency exchanges and SWIFT banking systems. In 2024, Lazarus Group deployed the Manuscrypt RAT and the TraderTraitor malware in attacks against DeFi platforms. The group exploited CVE-2024-21887 in Ivanti Connect Secure VPN for initial access. Lazarus has been linked to the $600M Ronin Bridge cryptocurrency theft in 2022 and continues to generate revenue for the DPRK regime through cyber operations.""",

The group uses living-off-the-land (LOTL) techniques, relying on built-in Windows tools like PowerShell, WMI, and netsh rather than deploying custom malware. Volt Typhoon gains initial access through exploitation of internet-facing devices, particularly Fortinet FortiGuard, Ivanti Connect Secure, and SOHO routers. The group has been pre-positioning in critical infrastructure networks for potential future disruption.

MuddyWater uses the PowGoop loader, the Small Sieve backdoor, and custom PowerShell scripts for post-exploitation. In 2024, the group deployed a new variant of the Dindoor backdoor linked to CVE-2026-3055 in Microsoft Exchange.

Scattered Spider has targeted major casino and hospitality companies including MGM Resorts and Caesars Entertainment. The group deploys ransomware (including ALPHV/BlackCat) after gaining access, and has been observed exfiltrating data for double extortion.

The backdoor was inserted by a maintainer account (Jia Tan) that had been contributing to the project for over two years. The vulnerability allows remote code execution through the liblzma compression library when it is linked into OpenSSH via systemd. The backdoor modifies RSA signature verification to enable unauthorized access. Multiple Linux distributions including Fedora 41, Debian testing, openSUSE Tumbleweed, and Kali Linux were affected before the backdoor was discovered.

The malware was delivered through a spearphishing email containing a malicious macro document. Lateral movement was achieved using stolen credentials and Mimikatz. On January 16, the incident response team isolated Server ALPHA, rotated all domain admin credentials, and deployed EDR across the network. By January 20, Server ALPHA was rebuilt from clean images, patched, and returned to production.

The group's toolset includes the Carbon backdoor, the Kazuar RAT, the Gazer trojan, and the Snake rootkit. In 2024, Turla was observed compromising Pakistani APT infrastructure (Storm-0156) to conduct operations against Afghan and Indian targets, demonstrating its ability to hijack other threat actors' infrastructure.
