"""
YARA rule parser — plyara wrapper.

Phase 3: wraps ``plyara.Plyara`` and normalises the output to a stable
shape we can rely on downstream.

Notes on plyara 2.2.x output (observed, verified against fixtures):
    * ``metadata`` is a *list of single-key dicts*, not a flat mapping.
    * Rule-level tags appear under ``tags`` on each rule dict (absent
      entirely when the rule has no tags).
    * Imports are attached to a rule dict only when that rule's condition
      references the import namespace. Parser-level imports live on
      ``Plyara.imports`` (a set). We copy them onto every rule so
      downstream code can rely on a per-rule ``imports`` list.
    * ``rule_name``, ``condition_terms``, ``raw_meta``/``raw_strings``/
      ``raw_condition`` are always present.

The parser preserves plyara's original keys and adds:
    * ``meta``: dict flattened from ``metadata`` (last-write-wins for dup
      keys; CCCS rules are expected to have unique keys).
    * ``imports``: list copied from parser-level ``Plyara.imports`` if the
      rule dict lacks one.
    * ``raw_rule``: the substring of the source file that produced this
      rule, carved by ``start_line``/``stop_line``. Useful for persisting
      rule text back into a note.
