# ZettelForge

<!-- mcp-name: io.github.rolandpg/zettelforge -->

**The only agentic memory system built for cyber threat intelligence.**

When a senior analyst leaves, two or three years of context walks out with them — customer environments, prior investigations, actor TTPs, false-positive patterns, every hard-won "wait, we've seen this before." ZettelForge is an agentic memory system built so that context stays with the team.

It extracts CVEs, threat actors, IOCs, and ATT&CK techniques from analyst notes and threat reports, resolves aliases (APT28 = Fancy Bear = STRONTIUM = Sofacy), builds a STIX 2.1 knowledge graph, and serves every past investigation back to your analysts — and to Claude Code via MCP — in natural language. Runs entirely in-process. No API keys. No cloud. No data leaves the host.

## The problem

Every SOC loses analysts. When they leave, investigation context, actor attribution, and environment-specific false-positive patterns go with them. Their replacements re-open the same tickets, re-read the same reports, and re-build the same mental models from scratch.

General-purpose AI memory systems don't fix this for security teams. They can't tell APT28 from Fancy Bear, don't know that CVE-2024-3094 is the XZ Utils backdoor, can't parse Sigma or YARA, and have no concept of MITRE ATT&CK technique IDs. When a CTI analyst gives them a year of intel reports, they get back fuzzy semantic search over chat history.

ZettelForge was built for analysts who think in threat graphs. It extracts CVEs, threat actors, IOCs, and ATT&CK techniques automatically, resolves aliases across naming conventions, builds a knowledge graph with causal relationships, and retrieves memories using intent-aware blended search — all in-process, with no external API dependency.

## Features

**Entity Extraction** — Automatically identifies CVEs, threat actors, IOCs (IPs, domains, hashes, URLs, emails), MITRE ATT&CK techniques, campaigns, intrusion sets, tools, people, locations, and organizations. Regex + LLM NER with STIX 2.1 types throughout.

**Knowledge Graph** — Entities become nodes, co-occurrence becomes edges. LLM infers causal triples ("APT28 *uses* Cobalt Strike"). Temporal edges and supersession track how intelligence evolves.

**Alias Resolution** — APT28, Fancy Bear, Sofacy, STRONTIUM all resolve to the same actor node. Works automatically on store and recall.

**Blended Retrieval** — Vector similarity (768-dim fastembed, ONNX) + graph traversal (BFS over knowledge graph edges), weighted by intent classification. Five intent types: factual, temporal, relational, exploratory, causal.

**Memory Evolution** — With `evolve=True`, new intel is compared to existing memory. LLM decides ADD, UPDATE, DELETE, or NOOP. Stale intel gets superseded. Contradictions get resolved. Duplicates get skipped.

**RAG Synthesis** — Synthesize answers across all stored memories with `direct_answer` format.

**In-process by architecture** — fastembed (ONNX) for embeddings, llama-cpp-python for LLM features, SQLite + LanceDB for storage. No external network calls in the default configuration. Runs on a laptop, a workstation, or an air-gapped host — same code, same behavior.

**Audit logging in OCSF schema** — Every operation emits a structured event in the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework format. What you do with the log stream (SIEM, WORM store, nothing) is up to you.

## Quick Start

```bash
pip install zettelforge
```

```python
from zettelforge import MemoryManager

mm = MemoryManager()

# Store threat intel — entities extracted automatically
mm.remember("APT28 uses Cobalt Strike for lateral movement via T1021")

# Recall with alias resolution
results = mm.recall("What tools does Fancy Bear use?")
# Returns the APT28 note (APT28 = Fancy Bear, resolved automatically)

# Synthesize across all memories
answer = mm.synthesize("Summarize known APT28 TTPs")
```

No TypeDB, no Ollama, no Docker — just `pip install`. Embeddings run in-process via fastembed. LLM features (extraction, synthesis) activate when Ollama is available.

### With Ollama (enables LLM features)

```bash
ollama pull qwen2.5:3b && ollama serve
# ZettelForge auto-detects Ollama for extraction and synthesis
```

### Memory Evolution

```python
# New intel arrives — evolve=True enables memory evolution:
# LLM extracts facts, compares to existing notes, decides ADD/UPDATE/DELETE/NOOP
mm.remember(
    "APT28 has shifted tactics. They dropped DROPBEAR and now exploit edge devices.",
    domain="cti",
    evolve=True,   # existing APT28 note gets superseded, not duplicated
)
```

## How It Works

Every `remember()` call triggers a pipeline:

1. **Entity Extraction** — regex + LLM NER identifies CVEs, intrusion sets, threat actors, tools, campaigns, ATT&CK techniques, IOCs (IPv4, domain, URL, MD5/SHA1/SHA256, email), people, locations, organizations, events, activities, and temporal references (19 types)
2. **Knowledge Graph Update** — entities become nodes, co-occurrence becomes edges, LLM infers causal triples
3. **Vector Embedding** — 768-dim fastembed (ONNX, in-process, 7ms/embed) stored in LanceDB
4. **Supersession Check** — entity overlap detection marks stale notes as superseded
5. **Dual-Stream Write** — fast path returns in ~45ms; causal enrichment is deferred to a background worker

Every `recall()` call blends two retrieval strategies:

1. **Vector similarity** — semantic search over embeddings
2. **Graph traversal** — BFS over knowledge graph edges, scored by hop distance
3. **Intent routing** — query classified as factual/temporal/relational/causal/exploratory, weights adjusted per type
4. **Cross-encoder reranking** — ms-marco-MiniLM reorders final results by relevance

## Benchmarks

Evaluated against published academic benchmarks:

| Benchmark | What it measures | Score |
|---|---|---|
| **CTI Retrieval** | Attribution, CVE linkage, multi-hop | **75.0%** |
| **RAGAS** | Retrieval quality (keyword presence) | **78.1%** |
| **LOCOMO** (ACL 2024) | Conversational memory recall | **22.0%** *(with Ollama cloud models)* |

See the [full benchmark report](benchmarks/BENCHMARK_REPORT.md) for methodology and analysis.

## MCP Server (Claude Code)

Add ZettelForge as a memory backend for Claude Code:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "zettelforge": {
      "command": "python3",
      "args": ["-m", "zettelforge.mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Your Claude Code agent can now remember and recall threat intelligence across sessions.

Exposed tools: `remember`, `recall`, `synthesize`, `entity`, `graph`, `stats`.

## Detection Rules as Memory (Sigma + YARA)

Sigma and YARA rules are first-class memory primitives. Parse, validate, and ingest a rule and its tags become graph edges: MITRE ATT&CK techniques, CVEs, threat-actor aliases, tools, and malware families resolve against the same ontology as every other note. A shared `DetectionRule` supertype carries `SigmaRule` and `YaraRule` subtypes, so a single rule UUID is addressable across both formats.

Sigma rules are validated against the vendored [SigmaHQ JSON schema](https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma-specification). YARA rules are parsed with plyara and checked against the [CCCS YARA metadata standard](https://github.com/CybercentreCanada/CCCS-Yara) (tiers: `strict`, `warn`, `non_cccs`). Ingest is idempotent — re-ingesting an unchanged rule returns the original note via a content-hashed `source_ref`.

```python
from zettelforge import MemoryManager
from zettelforge.sigma import ingest_rule as ingest_sigma
from zettelforge.yara import ingest_rule as ingest_yara

mm = MemoryManager()
ingest_sigma("rules/proc_creation_win_office_macro.yml", mm)
ingest_yara("rules/webshell_china_chopper.yar", mm, tier="warn")
```

```bash
# Bulk ingest from SigmaHQ or a private rule repo
python -m zettelforge.sigma.ingest /path/to/sigma/rules/
python -m zettelforge.yara.ingest /path/to/yara/rules/ --tier warn

# CI fixture check — parse + validate, no writes
python -m zettelforge.sigma.ingest rules/ --dry-run
```

An LLM rule explainer (`zettelforge.detection.explainer.explain`) produces a structured JSON summary — intent, key fields, evasion notes, false-positive hypotheses — for any `DetectionRule`. It runs synchronously on demand in v1; async enrichment-queue wiring is v1.1. Rate-limited via `ZETTELFORGE_EXPLAIN_RPM` (default 60 calls/minute).

## Integrations

### ATHF (Agentic Threat Hunting Framework)

Ingest completed [ATHF](https://github.com/Nebulock-Inc/agentic-threat-hunting-framework) hunts into ZettelForge memory. MITRE techniques and IOCs are extracted and linked in the knowledge graph.

```bash
python examples/athf_bridge.py /path/to/hunts/
# 12 hunt(s) parsed
# Ingested 12/12 hunts into ZettelForge
```

See [examples/athf_bridge.py](examples/athf_bridge.py).
